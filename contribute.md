Are you a climber? If so, I'm sure you have a lot of great experiences to share. Help me increase the average quality of this website's content by submitting an article of your own! (Note: you'll be featured in the [archives](/articles) forever, unless you don't want to be.)

To submit content, you can either use the editor below or send an email to [owen.jow01@gmail.com](mailto:owen.jow01@gmail.com). Your article(s) will be proofread and reviewed for quality within five business days (you should expect an email response). If approved, said article(s) will be published on the website within the same amount of time. If not, we can work on it. :)

Submission guidelines:

1. You can write about pretty much anything related to climbing â€“ mountaineering, free soloing, buildering... whatever floats your boat. Guides, exciting episodes, and TIL stories are all good. Basically, aim to write things that other people would want to read.
2. Try to keep it appropriate. Keep profanity/vulgarities to a minimum. If you think that over 20% of the climbing community would be offended by something in your article, please tone it down!
