This site is meant to serve as a hub of useful and/or entertaining articles for beginning climbers, while doubling as an online journal through which altruistic experts can easily share their experiences.

I am a novice myself, with no credentials to speak of (besides my excitement to train, improve my technique, and climb everything in sight). I created Bolder Bouldering after failing to find a centralized source of information for newcomers â€“ and God forbid I actually have to go out and _talk_ to people in order to learn everything.

My hope is that by aggregating knowledge on this website I can (a) pick up worthwhile insights and (b) make it more convenient for other people to pick up worthwhile insights. With a bit of luck, we can all optimize our training routines... and read some great stories while we're at it.
