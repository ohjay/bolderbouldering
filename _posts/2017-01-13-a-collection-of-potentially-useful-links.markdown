I'll need a bit of time to gather enough content for a real article, so while you're waiting you can tide yourself over on these. Alternatively, you might want to [write an article yourself](/contribute)!

- [Beginner's Guide to Rock Climbing (ACTIVE)][beginners-guide]
- [Six Basic Finger Grips for Face Climbing (About.com)][six-basic]
- [Rock Climbing Holds \| How to Climb Them (Mpora)][holds]
- [Don't Get Strong. Get Good (Evening Sends)][get-good]
- [Climbing Glossary (Stronghold Climbing Gym)][glossary]
- [7 Simple Drills to Improve Technique (Climbing.com)][drills]
- [Training and Goal Setting (Moon Climbing)][goals]
- [Your Goal: Boulder Harder (Climbing.com)][harder]
- [Bouldering for Beginners (Vcrux.com)][for-beginners]
- [Neil Gresham's Video Tutorials (YouTube)][neil-gresham]

(It's pretty much all bouldering-related reference content for beginners.)
