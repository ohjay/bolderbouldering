About a week ago, I had the privilege of introducing two friends to bouldering at my local climbing gym.

Of course, I didn't climb any of my nemesis projects that day. Instead I would climb the easy boulders together with my friends, focusing on demonstrating proper bouldering technique and hoping that they would learn by example.

We had a lot of fun and in the end they both completed a boulder that they didn't think they would be able to manage beforehand!

One thing that struck me, however, was that at some point they both complained about how incredibly pumped their arms were.

After an hour or so, both of them could barely maintain a grip on the holds anymore, even if they were jugs. Out of desperation, they started to grab onto some of the holds with their forearms, just because they didn't have any power left in their arms!

At the same time, my arms felt completely fresh. Not to brag, but they were actually just starting to feel warmed up. I boulder about 4 times a week.

It got me thinking about the techniques that I use to prevent my forearms from getting pumped. Later that day, I came up with a [list of more than 10 ways to avoid pump when climbing](https://climbingblogger.com/how-to-avoid-pump-when-climbing) and published it on my blog, over at climbingblogger.com.

Today, having the honor to write the first article on Owen’s bouldering blog, I’d like to share with you the three ways to avoid pump that I think are the most useful out of all the ways that I came up with.

My aim for this article is for it to be useful to both beginning, intermediate, and more experienced climbers.

Are you ready to dive in with me?

Let’s go!

### **1. Stretched arms**

If there’s one thing you should take away from this article (if you’re just getting into climbing), it’s that you should try to keep your arms stretched at basically all times.

Using your muscles intensively builds lactate. And lactate is the cause of pump in your forearms.

When you keep your arms stretched, however, you’re basically leveraging the structure of your bones and tendons in your arms to carry most of your weight. You will use way less muscle power when you keep your arms stretched. As a result, you don’t build as much lactate in your forearms, if any at all, and ultimately conquer the pump before it even has a chance to appear.

Trust me – that day I went climbing with my friends, I saw more bent arms than I normally see during an entire week of bouldering. It’s my conviction that this is the main reason they got pumped and I didn’t, even if I may have some more strength in my arms through practise than they do.

### **2. Kneebars**

To all intermediate climbers, I think it’s really fruitful to constantly remind yourself to be on the lookout for hidden kneebar spots on the wall.

As you may know, a kneebar is a technique where you jam your knee behind a hold and build pressure between your knee and foot so that it can support all of your weight.

Whenever two holds are half a leg apart and one of those holds is somewhat big, there’s a good chance you can throw a kneebar in.

Kneebars provide a most welcome opportunity for your arms to rest. In many cases you can simply let go with both your arms and let them hang for a while. This gives your arms the chance to recuperate. It helps with the blood flow, which will take away some lactate and also bring your forearms the oxygen that they're craving.  

Remember I said my friends completed a boulder that they thought they wouldn’t be able to do? They actually both did it using a kneebar! Well done, Padawan!

### **3. Mid-climb massage**

To all of you advanced climbers out there, I don’t have to tell you what a kneebar is, because you already know. Nor is it any new information to you that shaking your arms helps you get rid of pump – because you do it all the time.

But did you know you can actually speed up the remission of pump by massaging your forearms mid-climb?

“How am I supposed to massage myself when I’m full crimping an edge?” you may ask.

Well, that’s where your knees come in handy, too. A lot of times, you can position your feet in such a way that your knees point upwards. When this is the case, you can press your forearms against your knees and roll them around, one at a time, thus massaging them without having to relinquish a grip.

The great thing about this is that the added pressure on your knee can actually solidify the grip of your foot on the wall. So it’s a win-win.

So there you have it! These are my top 3 favorite ways to get rid of pump when bouldering.

What’s your favorite weapon against climbers pump?
